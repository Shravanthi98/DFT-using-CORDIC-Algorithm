# IMPLEMENTATION OF DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORM USING CORDIC ALGORITHM

This project deals with the implementation of DFT using CORDIC Algorithm in its rotation mode of operation. The twiddle factors, i.e. the phase rotation factors, required in DFT computations are calculated by CORDIC algorithm. Moreover, by utilizing some trigonometric identities in the DFT calculation CORDIC rotators are effectively used. This implementation reduces the complexity of the DFT by a great amount without compromising on the accuracy of the result.
